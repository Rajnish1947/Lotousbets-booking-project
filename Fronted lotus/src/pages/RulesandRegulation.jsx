          <strong>PART A - INTRODUCTION</strong><br />
          Use and interpretation<br />
          These Rules and Regulations (Rules) are part of the Lotus Bets terms and conditions.
          The Rules apply to all bets placed on this online betting platform (Lotus Bets). The Rules consist of the following:
          Introduction Section (Part A);
          The General Rules (Set out in Part B below); and
          The Specific Sports Rules (set out in Part C below - these apply to certain sports).
          The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules. If there is any inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail.
          The rules governing how markets are offered, managed and/or settled are not the same for every market on each product. In certain circumstances, a bet that is settled as a winner on one product may be settled as a loser on the other product (and vice versa). Additionally, different settlement rules may apply so that, for example, bets that are a winner on one product may be settled as a dead heat or be voided on the other product. Customers must ensure that they familiarise themselves with the relevant rules that apply to the bets that they place on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Customer Responsibility</strong><br />
          Customers should make themselves aware of all of the Rules affecting any market on which they wish to place a bet.
          In particular, customers who use the one-click option to place bets are solely responsible for their actions and the Site shall have no liability to such customers for any errors made by customers when using this option.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>PART B - GENERAL RULES</strong><br />
          <em>Matters beyond the Site's reasonable control and malfunctions</em><br />
          The Site is not liable for any loss or damage you may suffer because of any:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-5">
            <li>Act of God.</li>
            <li>Power cut.</li>
            <li>Trade or labour dispute.</li>
            <li>Act, failure or omission of any government or authority.</li>
            <li>Obstruction or failure of telecommunication services.</li>
            <li>Any other delay or failure caused by a third party or otherwise outside of our control.</li>
          </ul>
          In such an event, the Site reserves the right to cancel or suspend access to the Site without incurring any liability.
          The Site is not liable for the failure of any equipment or software howsoever caused, wherever located or administered, or whether under its direct control or not, that may prevent the operation of the Site.
          In the event of a technological failure or error which is apparent to the customer, the customer is obliged to notify the Site of such failure/error immediately. If the customer continues to place a bet in these circumstances, they shall take reasonable action to minimise any potential loss. In the absence of such action, the Site reserves the right to void a bet.
          The Site reserves the right in its absolute discretion to restrict access to the Site, or withhold funds or void any bets outstanding to a customer’s account in its absolute discretion in the event of a technological failure or other malfunction which affects the integrity of the Site whether this is under its direct control or otherwise. Customers will be notified on the Site of any such malfunction which may operate to prevent the placing of further bets or which may result in outstanding bets being voided.

          <strong>Managing markets In-Play</strong><br />
          <em>General</em><br />
          For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-5">
            <li>if the event has a scheduled off time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be void; and</li>
            <li>if the event does not have a scheduled off time, the Site will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual off and all bets after the time of the off determined by the Site will be void.</li>
          </ul>
          For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then all bets matched after the official off time will be void.
          The Site aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play markets at the start of and at the end of the event. However, the Site does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.
          Customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all times.
          For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that transmissions described as live by some broadcasters may actually be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data.
          All markets other than soccer markets - not suspending at the time of the off
          In relation to markets which are scheduled to be turned in-play, the Site aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play at the time of the off. However, the Site does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at the time of the off.
          If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market and cancel unmatched bets at the time of the off and the market is not turned in-play with unmatched bets cancelled at any time during the event, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the off will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the official rather than the scheduled off time). If the event does not have a scheduled off time, the Site will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual off and all bets after the time of the off determined by the Site will be void.
          If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market at the time of the off (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market is intentionally turned in-play at a later time during the event, all bets matched after the time of the off will stand.
